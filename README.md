EurKEY-Mac
==========

The Keyboard Layout for Europeans, Coders and Translators - Version for Mac OS X.

This is a port of the [EurKEY Keyboard layout](http://eurkey.steffen.bruentjen.eu/), which features a QWERTY baseline layout (=good access to braces etc.) with quick access to commonly used accented characters and Umlauts.

**Status**: The whole layout should be mapped now. Please report if you find any missing characters.

**Additions**: 

 - Added ą and ę for Polish: ´q = ą, ´d = ę (and uppercase)
 - Added the "punt volat" for Catalan:  ´. = · 
 - Added additional currency signs: ´4 = ₡ (Costa Rican colón), ¨4 = ₩ (Korean won), `5 = ₽ (Russian rubble), ¨5 = ₹ (Indian rupee)


Install
=======

Copy the two files `EurKEY.keylayout` and `EurKEY.icns` to your library, either system-wide (`/Library/Keyboard Layouts`) or for your local user (`~/Library/Keyboard Layouts`). A system-wide installation is preferred to ensure the layout is available to all applications. (See also [this Superuser answer](https://superuser.com/a/561613/263461).) For the changes to take effect a restart is required.


How to use the Keyboard
=======
After the restart go to `System Settings` > `Keyboard` > `Edit` > `+` and search for `EurKEY v1.2`. After adding the layout select its symbol from the menu bar icon.
